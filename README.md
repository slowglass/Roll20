# Roll20

This repo contains my scripts that I use to run my Roll20 D&D game.
Currently they are designed just for me (hence the hard coded configutation).
If anyone stumbles upon these scripts and finds them usefull, please drop me
a line (Christopher.James.Davies@gmail.com). I am happy to work on improving the
scripts if other people are actually using them.

The scripts are as follows
1. Utils.js - Utilities script used by the other scripts
2. Conditions.js - Manage the conditions flags on tokens using [Custom Token Markers](https://wiki.roll20.net/Custom_Token_Markers)
